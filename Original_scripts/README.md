# Gaze Bias Differences Capture Individual Choice Behavior

This repository contains data and python code to reproduce all analyses performed in the manuscript:

[**Gaze Bias Differences Capture Individual Choice Behavior**](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/12/04/228825)  
Thomas, A. W.**<sup>&ast;</sup>** & Molter, F.**<sup>&ast;</sup>**, Krajbich, I., Heekeren, H. R. H. & Mohr, P. N. C.  
*bioRxiv* 228825. **doi:** https://doi.org/10.1101/228825  

<sup>&ast;</sup>shared first authorship with equal contribution

The analyses can be viewed and run separately as Jupyter notebooks (files with `.ipynb` extension). Alternatively, all analyses can be run automatically by calling the `run_all_analyses.sh` shell script. Running the script will convert notebooks to `.py` scripts and run them in succession. This will reproduce all figures contained in the manuscript and you will have to close the figure pop ups for the script to continue.
